# jbeatbox
> BeatBox swing app, with simple networking and chat capabilities.

Created a long time ago while reading [Head First Java, Second Edition](http://www.headfirstlabs.com/books/hfjava/).

# Usage

Quick notes for adventurous developers who may want to try this beautiful beatbox:

* jbeatbox-client and jbeatbox-server should specify jbeatbox-common in their build path.
* jbeatbox-server should always be started first.
* Disconnecting any jbeatbox-client from the server will make it crash badly.
